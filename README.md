# Project Description
This project aimed to advance soil classification for sustainable agriculture using deep learning techniques. A dataset of 1,300 soil images representing four types: alluvial, clay, red, and black soil was compiled, ensuring diversity for robust model training. Preprocessing involved standardizing images to 100x100 pixels and normalizing pixel values for consistency. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), insights into image properties were gained, and patterns crucial for model development were identified. Implemented two deep learning models, DenseNet121 and ResNet50, they were fine-tuned using techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, and adding/reducing the units in the custom dense layers to address overfitting & underfitting issues. ResNet50 emerged with superior accuracy, achieving 87.63% compared to DenseNet121 which achieved an accuracy of 85.57%. The methodology showcases deep learning's potential to revolutionize soil analysis, offering more efficient and accurate means for sustainable land management practices.
